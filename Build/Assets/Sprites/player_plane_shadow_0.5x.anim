# File is formatted as follows:
#
# COMMENTS
#
# Each '#' stands for comment line. It must be the first character on comment line.
# Comments can appear on any line.
#
# FRAMES
#
# frame (SDL rectangle) definitions are listed after line which states simple "frames" and nothing more
# Work "frames" must be the only word on that line, and line must not contain any whitespaces.
# 
# Each frame definition is an int-quadruplet {x,y,w,h}.
# 
# SEQUENCES
# 
# Sequences are specified after word "sequences", and same conditions apply as for "frame" word. 
# Each sequence is an integer list, each integer separated by a SINGLE whitespace, and no whitespace after
# last integer is allowed.
#
# Each integer stands for index in the frame array, and order of frames listed previously 
# affects these values. First frame quadruplet is in index 0, second in index 1, and so on.
